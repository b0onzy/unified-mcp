# Unified-MCP Development Progress Tracker

## Current Status
**Phase:** Knowledge Foundation (1 of 5)  
**Week:** 1 of 26  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-24

## This Week's Focus
- [ ] Complete memory systems research
- [ ] Prototype basic MCP integration  
- [ ] Set up development environment

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Project documentation structure
- [x] Market analysis and competitive research
- [x] Technical architecture design
- [x] GitHub issue tracking setup

## Active Research Areas
1. **Vector Databases** - Performance comparison (pgvector vs Weaviate vs ChromaDB)
2. **MCP Integration** - Testing memory servers and client patterns
3. **Context Compression** - Investigating semantic compression techniques

## Next Week
- Begin prototype development
- Test first MCP memory integration
- Validate core architecture assumptions

## Blockers
None currently

## Key Decisions Made
- Using MCP as primary AI integration layer
- PostgreSQL + pgvector for production storage
- Phase-based development approach with validation checkpoints

## Metrics
- Research items completed: 25/87 (28.7%)
- Documentation: 4/5 core files complete
- Time to MVP: 2-4 weeks remaining
