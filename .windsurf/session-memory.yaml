# Unified-MCP - Session Memory
# This file captures the context and decisions made during this development session

## Project Overview
name: Unified-MCP (Unified Model Context Protocol)
description: A standardized, MCP-compatible memory fabric for AI coding assistants that provides persistent, structured context across sessions and tools.

## Key Decisions
1. **Architecture**:
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) as the core protocol
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Support for both local and cloud deployments
   - Multi-level context management (User, Session, Project, Team)

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
   - PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector search
   - Redis for caching
   - WebSocket and stdio transports

3. **Implementation Phases**:
   - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Foundation & Core
   - Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Context Management
   - Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Intelligent Search
   - Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Developer Experience
   - Phase 5 (Weeks 17-20): Team & Enterprise
   - Phase 6 (Weeks 21-24): Ecosystem & Scale

## Research Findings
### User Pain Points
- Context loss between sessions
- Limited memory persistence
- Poor integration with existing tools
- Lack of personalization

### Key Features Needed
1. Multi-level context management
2. Semantic/vector search
3. Seamless IDE integration
4. Git/GitHub integration
5. Team collaboration features
6. Robust security and privacy controls

### Implementation Insights
- **From Context7**:
  - Pipeline-based context management
  - Focus on documentation and code example retrieval
  - MCP protocol integration

- **From GitHub MCP Server**:
  - Comprehensive GitHub integration
  - Dynamic tool discovery
  - Strong authentication and security

## Current Focus
- Phase 1: Foundation & Core implementation
- Setting up development environment
- Defining core protocols and data models
- Implementing storage layer with PostgreSQL and pgvector

## Success Metrics
- Performance: <50ms context retrieval (p95)
- Reliability: 99.99% uptime SLA
- Scalability: 10,000+ RPS per node
- Developer Experience: <5 minute setup time

## Next Steps
1. Implement core protocol types and interfaces
2. Set up database schema and migrations
3. Create basic repository layer
4. Implement MCP protocol server
5. Add authentication and authorization

## Open Questions
- Specific vector search requirements for code context
- Optimal cache invalidation strategy
- Fine-grained permission model details
